## **Employee Management System with a Landing page and Applicants' Dashboard**

This employee management system is a comprehensive platform that integrates key **HR** and **administrative** functions into a single interface.

It enables employees to clock in and manage their **attendance** within a designated **time frame**, ensuring **accurate** records. 
If employees need to take **time off**, they can submit **permission requests** directly from their dashboard, streamlining the process and ***reducing paperwork***. 

HR professionals have robust tools to create and manage **job postings**, **evaluate applicants**, and oversee ongoing **recruitment** efforts. 
Once an applicant submits their information, they can **track their application** progress using a dedicated dashboard, giving them real-time updates and reducing **communication** delays. 
Applicants can also delete their applications, submit multiple applications for different job openings, and track them all through their dashboard. 
This level of automation and user-focused design makes the platform both efficient and user-friendly.

On the administrative side, the system automatically calculates **payroll** for all employees based on attendance records, ensuring that salaries are **paid** on time at the end of each month. 

Built with a modern tech stack—JavaScript, React, TailwindCSS, Express.js, and MongoDB—this project not only provides smooth front-end interactions but also maintains a solid back-end infrastructure for data management. 
Additionally, applicants have their own dashboard where they can populate their information, upload resumes and cover letters, and track their job applications. 
The ability to manage **multiple** applications at once further enhances the user experience, ensuring a streamlined process for both **applicants** and **HR administrators**.
