DaloChat was a personal project I built with the primary goal of expanding my skills and deepening my understanding of real-time communication systems. 
Although it looks like a SAAS platform as it has animated landing page, it wasnâ€™t intended to be a product or startup but a learning experience that pushed me to explore new technologies and concepts. 

By developing a full-fledged chat app, I aimed to gain hands-on experience with building complex features like **real-time messaging**, **group management**, 
and OAuth2-based **authentication**, all while ensuring **smooth** front-end and back-end **integration**. 
Working with **socket.io** for **real-time** updates was particularly valuable, as it taught me how to handle live data efficiently across multiple users, 
an essential skill for real-time applications.

Beyond the technical challenges, I also wanted to refine my ability to create user-centric interfaces. Using tools like React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, 
I focused on crafting an **interactive** and **responsive UI** that remains in sync with the database at all times. This project was an opportunity to explore 
various libraries such as Shadcn UI, Zustand, and TanStack, which further expanded my knowledge of state management and UI design patterns. 
Overall, DaloChat helped me grow as a developer by pushing my understanding of front-end and back-end technologies, making it an excellent learning project 
that advanced my skills in real-time web development.
