### **File Uploader (mini Google Drive)**

The file uploader project was an ambitious endeavor aimed at creating a **cloud storage** service akin to **Google Drive**. 
This application allows users to **upload** their **files** directly to the **server** while providing a seamless and user-friendly experience. 
Key features include an image preview functionality that lets users see their files before uploading, a flexible **drag-and-drop** box 
for easy file management, and a **robust authentication** system that supports traditional email-password logins as well as OAuth providers 
like Google and GitHub. The interactive UI enhances user engagement, making the file upload process intuitive and efficient.

Throughout this project, I had the opportunity to dive deep into full-stack development using Next.js for the first time. 
I practiced various aspects of **Next.js**, including **server components**, **server actions**, and **middleware**, while leveraging the 
latest **app router** for optimized routing. 

Additionally, I utilized built-in **client-side routing** and took advantage of image and font optimizations to improve performance. 
Employing **TypeScript** alongside **Zod** helped ensure better code quality through type safety and validation. 
I also integrated **Resend** for **sending emails**, rounding out the functionality of the application.
