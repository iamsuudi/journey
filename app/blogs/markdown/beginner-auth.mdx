# Beginner Auth in React and Express with JWT

In this post, we'll cover how to build a simple authentication flow in a **React** frontend and **Express** backend using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** and **localStorage**. This is a great starting point for building secure apps and learning how to manage authentication.

## What is JWT?

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a standard for securely transmitting information between a client and a server. It is commonly used for authentication purposes. A JWT typically consists of three parts:

1. **Header**: Contains the type of token (JWT) and the signing algorithm.
2. **Payload**: Contains the claims (data about the user or session).
3. **Signature**: A hashed version of the header and payload combined with a secret key.

When the user logs in, the server sends a signed JWT to the client, which the client stores (e.g., in localStorage). The client includes this token in subsequent requests to prove their identity.

## Backend: Setting up JWT Authentication in Express

### Step 1: Set up an Express project

First, install the required packages:

```bash
npm install express jsonwebtoken bcryptjs cors
```

```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

// Hardcoded user (in a real app, fetch this from a database)
const user = {
  id: 1,
  username: 'admin',
  password: bcrypt.hashSync('password123', 8)  // Password is hashed
};

const secretKey = 'your-secret-key';

exports.login = (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;

  // Check if the username matches
  if (username !== user.username) {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Invalid username or password' });
  }

  // Check if the password matches
  const passwordIsValid = bcrypt.compareSync(password, user.password);
  if (!passwordIsValid) {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Invalid username or password' });
  }

  // Generate JWT
  const token = jwt.sign({ id: user.id }, secretKey, { expiresIn: '1h' });

  res.json({ token });
};

```
